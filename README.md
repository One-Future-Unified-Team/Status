We use [Issues](https://github.com/Software-and-Website-Developer-Team/Status/issues) as incident reports, [Actions](https://github.com/Software-and-Website-Developer-Team/Status/actions) as uptime monitors, and [Pages](https://Software-and-Website-Developer-Team.github.io/Status) for the status page.
